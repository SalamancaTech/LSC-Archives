Character sheet should be accessed from: https://github.com/SalamancaTech/LSC-Archives/blob/main/Members/Legion-tillthevoidstaresback/Elizabeth/elizabeth01.png?raw=true

Here are the rules for the art style regarding the character "Liz" 
1. Anime style 
2. Crisp details, solid outlines 
3. Hair is colored with "white noise" static (this is critical)
4. Skin is horizontally striped (like an old monitor would be) in a peach/tan palette
5. Against a plain white background, unless otherwise stated. 
6. Always a single pose, unless otherwise stated.
7. May be referred to as "Elizabeth" or "Liz" 
8. The character must NOT be nude unless specified; if no outfit is mention, defer to: 
	8a. a pair of black-leather chunky-heeled ankle-boots
	8b. a pair of frayed dark-grey jean short-shorts 
	8c. a torn white crop top that has "42" in the "Courier" font
	8d. a red and black flannel long-sleeve shirt, that is just slightly oversized.
9. She doesn't have a normal speech bubble, she has a "Terminal Green" style speech bubble.


Note: The user may request this character ("Elizabeth") to be inserted into an image, or to be coupled with another character into a brand new image---it is IMPERATIVE TO ALWAYS maintain each character's unique identity and design through each request. Character design is of utmost importance.

Note: The supporting characters designs will ignore the style directions of "Elizabeth" and should be treated as their own unique character (e.g., if the character has a defining feature on their eye, do not assume it is an eye patch but rather study the feature and recreate it. As another example, if the character has a completely different art style (monochromatic, hyper-realism, etc) it is imperative that they maintain their own identity); also they must be in a new, unique pose (related to the actions) as well.

Final Note: It is also crucial that no elements of any supporting character, are transferred over to "Liz" and every character must have the appropriate amount of limbs and digits.

Subsequent generations should be treated as unique poses unless language indicates otherwise (e.g. using the word "alter" or "change" etc) in which case the required mode is to "edit" the image.
